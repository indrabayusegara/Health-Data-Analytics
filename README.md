# Health-Data-Analytics

In this Health Data Analytics project, I used Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft SQL. The project aims to provide analytics on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients, including types, compulsions, and geographical distribution across countries. It serves to provide insights and generate reports for clinics or hospitals in need of data regarding patients with OCD.
